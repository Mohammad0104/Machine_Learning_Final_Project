Final Project - Machine Learning Theory and Applications (2023)

    Wine Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning:
        Conducted a comprehensive machine learning project to predict the quality of white wine based on physicochemical characteristics.

    Dataset Analysis:
        Analyzed a dataset with 12 attributes, including alcohol level, pH level, and citric acid, to identify features influencing wine quality.

    Model Development:
        Designed and implemented a multi-layer neural network model comprising 3 linear layers, 2 batch normalization layers, and 1 residual layer, optimizing for prediction accuracy.

    Training and Optimization:
        Trained the model using 100 batches over 25 epochs, achieving a peak training accuracy of 77%.

    Model Testing:
        Evaluated the model's performance, achieving a test accuracy of 72%, and assessed its reliability in predicting continuous numerical values of wine quality.

    Problem Definition:
        Addressed the regression problem of forecasting wine quality, utilizing input features related to the physicochemical properties of the wine.

    Collaboration and Presentation:
        Collaborated with a team member to present findings and model performance in a structured final presentation.

    Reference Utilization:
        Utilized the White Wine dataset from Kaggle as the foundation for the project, adhering to best practices in dataset selection and model development.
